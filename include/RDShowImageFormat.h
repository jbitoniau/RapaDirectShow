	ImageFormat
	
	The ImageFormat defines the fundamental characteristics of an Image:  
	- its size in pixels 
	- its encoding

	The encoding defines how the pixels of the image are laid out in the memory buffer owned by 
	the Image object. More precisely, it defines which color model.
	is used and how the components of the tuples representing the color are stored at the byte level.

	The Image/ImageFormat system only support
	- uncompressed data (no variable-length spatial/temporal compression like JPG, H264, etc...)
	- non-paletized image
	- pixel-oriented or "interleaved" data storage (as opposed to planar-oriented data) 
	
	The concept of stride/padding is not supported.

	Some references:
